# Predicting Titanic Survivors + EDA
At 2:20am on 15th April 1912, the British ocean liner Titanic sank into the North Atlantic Ocean about 400 miles south of Newfoundland, Canada. The massive ship, which carried 2,200 passengers and crew, had struck an iceberg two and half hours before.

Everybody said it was 'unsinkable'; no-one predicted its tragic demise. For a moving depiction of the Titanic's sinking I recommend the 1959 movie ["A Night to Remember"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051994/).

In this notebook I explore the famous Titanic dataset, accessed through the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
I use a range of visualisations and test several Machine Learning models to predict survivors.
